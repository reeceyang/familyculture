		<h1>Chinese Language</h1>
		<p>The Chinese language is Chinese. It is the oldest written language in the world, with over 6 milleniums of history. It is ideographic based, meaning each Chinese character represents an idea. There are 40,000 characters in a typical dictionary, and knowledge of 2,000 to 3,000 characters are needed to understand a common newspaper. There are two types of written Chinese: simplified and traditional. Below is my name written in simplified Chinese:</p>
		<p>杨悦时</p>
		<p>This is my name written in traditional Chinese:</p>
		<p>楊悅時</p>
		<p>Pin-yin, spellings of Chinese characters in the Western alphabet were created to help the Western world understand Chinese better. Below is my name writtend in Pin-yin:</p>
		<p>yáng yuè shí</p>
		<p>There are also many spoken dialects of Chinese. The most common dialects are Mandarin and Cantonese. Some members of my family can understand Mandarin, like my parents and I, but most of them speak a dialect native to our region. Speaking Chinese is in some ways easier and in some ways harder than speaking English. All characters are only one syllable and can start with a limited number of ways and end in a limited number of ways. On the other hand, each character also can have different tones, such as a flat tone, a rising tone, an inward tone, and a descending tone.</p>
		<p>In conclusion, Chinese is a language with rich cultural history and a very different paradigm then English. It is a very important part of my family culture.</p>
