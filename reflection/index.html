		<h2>Where did my family come from?</h2>
		<p>My family originates from the Hubei province in China. Both my dad and my mom came from poor farming villages near the towns of Huangshi and Daye. My intermediate family members are the only members of my family in America. The rest of my family still lives in or around Huangshi and Daye.</p>
		<h2>What is my cultural background?</h2>
		<p>My cultural background is Chinese. All known members of my family are Chinese.</p>
		<h2>What is my family's country or origin and how has it influenced who I am today?</h2>
		<p>My families country of origin is China. It has influenced me greatly today. For example, there are many oppurtunities that I can not take advantage of because I am a minority in America. It has also influenced who I am because Chinese parents place importance on different values then other parents.</p>
		<h2>What was life like for my ancestors?</h2>
		<p>My ancestors all lived in rural farming villages. My mother and father both helped on their family's farms.</p>
		<h2>Do I still have some of the same family traditions?</h2>
		<p>We still celebrate most of the Chinese Holidays, like the Spring Festival and the Mid-Autumn Festival. We continue to raise crops in our backyard garden.</p>
