		<h1>Chinese Food</h1>
		<p>Chinese food commonly comes to mind when people think about Chinese culture, and for good reason, because Chinese is one of the best parts about Chinese culture in my opinion. Each region in China has different cuisine, and they all taste good. However, because Chinese people will eat anything, they sometimes serve things that others would think are strange. Chinese food in China is often different from what you would find in America, too. Chinese cooks in America molded their dishes to fit American's tastes. Chinese food in America became very popular when it first appeared, even though Americans were suspicious of Chinese people at the time.</p>
		<p>In conclusion, Chinese food is a very important part of Chinese culture, and one of my favorite as well.</p>
